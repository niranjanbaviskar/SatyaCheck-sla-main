## üîÑ Data Processing

### Keyword Extraction

SatyaCheck uses spaCy to identify:
- Named entities (people, organizations, locations, events)
- Noun phrases
- Important verbs and nouns

### Post Matching

The system calculates match percentages based on:
- Keyword presence in social media posts
- Weighted importance of keywords
- Temporal relevance of posts

### Credibility Assessment

Credibility is determined through:
- Maximum keyword match percentage
- Number of supporting posts
- Sensationalism indicators
- Platform-specific metrics

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

- **Concurrent API Calls**: ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel data fetching
- **TTL Cache**: Caching results for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Streamlined text analysis pipeline
- **Firebase Integration**: Non-blocking activity logging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- API rate limits may affect search depth
- Analysis is limited to public posts on selected platforms
- Transformer model for fake news detection is currently a stub implementation
- Results depend on social media coverage of the topic

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Expand platform coverage (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
- Implement full transformer-based fake news detection
- Add sentiment analysis of matching posts
- Create user accounts to save and compare analyses
- Develop browser extension for one-click analysis
